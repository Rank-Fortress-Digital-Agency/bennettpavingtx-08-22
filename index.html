                    Fill any cracks with an asphalt sealant to prevent water from seeping in and causing further damage. You can fill potholes with cold patch asphalt. You may need to resurface your parking lot if the damage is extensive. Sweeping or power washing your parking lot will remove debris, oil, and other substances that can damage the asphalt. Be sure to repair any cracks or damage as soon as possible to prevent further deterioration.
